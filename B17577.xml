            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe God of heaven hath put it into my heart to write a few words unto you, in the fear and dread of his Name, and in the councel of his own Will, concerning the work which ye have taken in hand against him and his people; this is not the end and work for which the Lord God hath permitted you into the places of Government and Rule, in those Nations (nor the way for you to prosper, nor to prolong your daies in the earth) thus to persecute and afflict an innocent and harmless people, who are peaceable, and walk uprightly (towards God and man) therein, endeavouring (in all things) to keep their consciences void of offence, and who have no helper in the earth but the Lord alone, neither is their Kingdom of this world, but they are verily the children and servants of the most high God, whom he hath gathered from amongst men, and from the kindreds of the earth, to be the first fruits unto him, and to the lamb in this age; and we are his and not our own, he hath bought us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us unto himself, and to him alone have we committed our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent cause, and he hath undertaken to plead it for us, with all our adversaries, and no weapon formed against us shall ever prosper, but be broken to pieces.</p>
            <p>Therefore Friends, be awakened and open your eyes, and see what a stir and a do here is in this Nation, to hale and drag up and down a company of tender, innocent, harmless people, men and women, and children from their peaceable meetings, who meet together in the fear and tender love of God, without any evil or bad intent toward any, but have good will and compassion toward all men, even to the worst of our enemies, as the Lord bears us witness, and these are them that are driven as sheep to the slaughter, and thrown into your noysome

            <p>But what shall I say unto you, if ye will not or cannot believe our faithful testimony (or the testimony of God through us) and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of our cause and sufferings, neither will ye believe if one should rise from the dead and declare it unto you, for many tender visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ssengers, who have written and declared unto you in his Name and Power in this your day. And as for my part who am one of the least of the thousands of <hi>Israel,</hi> I could willingly have been silent as toward you at this time, but the Lord (whom I serve in my spirit) hath laid it upon me to warn you once more (for whose sakes I have born a burthen) in the true sight and sense of your sad estate, and of the day of thick darknesse, wrath and distress, which is hastening upon you from the Almighty.</p>
            <p>Wherefore be not proud nor rebellious, but hear, and obey the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204285:4"/>Word of the Lord, for thus saith the Lord God that made heaven and earth, <hi>Let my innocent People alone,</hi> and touch them not any more as ye have done for they are mine, and I have called them, and chosen them, and redeemed them, they are my Jewels which I am making up; they shall shew forth my glory before men to the whole world, I have anointed them, and I will preserve them and deliver them, and crown them with an everlasting salvation: <hi>I will rebuke Kings and Rulers for their sakes, and distress Nations, and disthrone the mighty from their seats that rise up against them, as I have done;</hi> and let my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Gospel have a free passage in these Nations, and do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and afflict my servants and messengers so any more, whom I have cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en and sent to preach and declare the way or life and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ends of the earth, but bow your car and your heart unto them and their testimony, that it may be well with you, and prolong your daies, for he that blesseth them shall be blessed and he that curseth them shall be cursed, and every hand shall wither that opposeth them, <hi>as hath been, and shall be, henceforth for ever: I the Lord have spoken it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But and if you will not hear, but will still persist, and go on as ye have done, to oppresse my heritage, and harmless people, and make war and opposition against my power and truth, and thus set your selves and your Power against me the living God; I will bring you down suddenly to the astonishment of Nations, and I'le cut your day short, and turn your pleasures into howling and lamention, and shame, and contempt, shall cover your memorial as a garment: Thus will I work for the deliverance of my seed, and none shall let it, for the year of my redeemed is come, and the day of vengeance is in my heart, to plead its cause with all flesh.</p>
            <p>Therefore consider your waies, and see what ye are doing, and what the effect of this your work will be, ye are but men, and the children of men, <hi>who were but as yesterday,</hi> your breath also is in your nostrils, and your life is but a vapour, which will soon vanish away: You labour in the very fire, and bring forth wind, which blows up the flame of that which will consume you, and deprive you of all happiness for ever (O that ye had but hearts to consider it) For the more you strive with the Lord, and oppresse his people, the more will they multiply and grow stronger &amp; stronger, and you shal wax weaker &amp; weaker, and your works shall be your heavy burthen, for life and immortality is risen, and the power of God is stirring in the hearts of thousands, and light under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (the excellent spirit which was in <hi>Daniel</hi>) is breaking forth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204285:5"/>like the lightning (which shines out of the East into the West) in the light of many people, whereby they know its the day of the coming of the Son of man, with power and great glory, that every eye may see him, and they that have pierced him shall mourn bitterly: So your labour is in vain, and your works for the fire, and your striving with your Maker to no purpose, as to effect your end and aim. And of these things you have been often forewarned, and the Lord hath been very long suffering towards you, in sparing you thus long, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you thus far to act against him and his dear people, and his mercy and forbearance hath been evidently shewed in a large measure unto you, in deferring his heavy judgements thus long, which must have been confest to be just upon you: And will you thus require the Lord, by increasing your tasks of oppression upon his tender innocent people? O unwise and ungrateful generation! hath not God yet shewed you, that you should do justly, and love mercy, and walk humbly? <hi>Mica</hi> 6.8. But are these your fruits and practises, fruits of Mercy or Justice? or if there be any tincture, or spark of love or humility in them? <hi>Let Gods witness (the light) in all your consciences, and in all people, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;</hi> I tell you plainly, that such fruits and doings among you, that profess your selves Christians, have made the very Name of Christ and Christianity a Proverb of reproach through Nations, and have caused the God of heaven to be blasphemed: and how could it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise? seeing you who profess the most knowledge of God, and have talked of converting the Heathen (as some of your leaders have done) are found the least in the life and fruits thereof: but to what would they convert them? to pride, and swearing, and drunkenness, and oppression, and all manner of excesse, and to persecute people for their good conscience? they have no need of that, for some of them have said, they did not use to swear and be drunk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till they came among the Christians, and learned of them, they did not do so in their own country, so ye are far from converting them, being out of the life of what ye profess and talk of your selves, that the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or Infidels (as ye call them) doth judge and condemn you (who are making enquiry) concerning these your proceedings against this harmless people, among whom some of them have been kindly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who visited them at the Lords requiring, though contrary in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and Religion, and this doth rise up in judgement against you.</p>
            <p>But friends, have not you your selves been under Sufferings, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204285:5"/>some of you been driven into strange Countrys or lands, for your cause (as it was called) Nay did not the King himselfe, once fly for refuge to a Tree, to save himselfe, from his Enemies hands; if not, why are there such representations made of it, in so many places in the Nation. And was not this a great mercy, and deliverance from God, so to obscure and preserve him, from them who pursued him (and many of you also) And are these things forgotten; can mercy be loved, except it be remembered? And do you remember and love his mercies, by doing justly, and walking humbly with him, as he doth require? or do you boast in a vaine glory as if your own arme had done it, or your own strength or desarts had delivered you, if so, then God must needs be forgotten, and his mercies trod under foot, and his visitations and counsels c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And were these your sufferings (which you sustained by them, ye opposed) unjust, and unequal, and if ye should say they were, then I say it is much more unjust and very unequall (in the sight of God, and all sober People that fear him) for you, thus to inflict such cruell sufferings (as Imprisoning and stifling up to Death, in your Noysome Gayles and holes, among Theives and Murtherers, And to pronounce sentence of Banishment upon an Innocent, harmles, peacable People, that do not oppose you in the least, with any outward force, neither doth so much as the thoughts of it, lodg within our breasts, as the Lord God knoweth (who have called us to peace) but on the contrary, have sought and do seeke, your wellfare and happiness, both in this world, and in the world to come, which in time shall be manifest to the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>And if you say your sufferings were unjust and unequall (though you did oppose them and make war against them so long as you could) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they deprived you of your rights and priviledges, and just li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and naturall birthrights, &amp;c. which was your due to injoy as being free born of the Nation: Then how much more is it unjust, and unequal, and unrighteous thus to inflict sufferings upon your friends, and oppresse your peacable Neighbours, who are freeborn People of the same Nation, and doth not oppose you, but are tender toward you (as aforesaid) And Subjects to all wholsom just Laws, and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to you, for which causes we ought to have our just liberty, and injoy the <hi>Priveledg</hi> of our <hi>Birthright</hi> which is our due, (so long as we live

And as we are the dearly beloved People of the most high God, who doth blesse us with his presence, and manifest his everlasting love and good will towards us daily, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadow us with his power and tender mercyes, whom he hath gathered out of the evill wayes, and spirit of this world and all the vanityes thereof unto himselfe, to walk with him who is invisible in the upright, blameless, undefiled Life, in the the midst of a Crooked and preverse Generation; I say considering these things, how greatly and unrighteously doth our sufferings appeare to all sober People, whose eyes are open, and will be more open to discern and favour the bitterness, of that proud envious wrathfull spirit, which thus hath acted you, and deceived you, and its end is numbered by them that have wisdome from above.</p>

If you had the hearts of men, or of flesh, ye would be afraid and blush, at the very thoughts hereof; my heart and foule melts within me, and I am even bowed down (with cryes to God) in my spirit, to think of the hardness of your hearts. God almighty cut short thy worke in Righteousnesse, and shorten the dayes of oppression and cruelty for thine elects sake, which cry night and day unto thee; And make known thy Name and power to the ends of the earth, and let the heathen here, and fear, and bow to thy Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous scepter; And let the Kings of the earth lay down their Crowns at the feet of the Lamb, that through thy righteous Judgments they may partake of thy tender mercies which endureth for ever; that their eys may be no longer withholden, nor blinded by the God of this world, (the power and prince of darkness) but that they might come to see thee, who art invisible and injoy the same precious Life, of pure unfeigned love, which abounds in the hearts of thy hidden ones; and receive thy peacable wisdome to be governed, and to govern therein; Then would they surely know, that we are thine and confesse to thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

And thy way of life and salvation is hid from them, therefore they hate us without a cause, and thus evilly entreat us in the darkness of their minds, and in the ignorance and hardness of their hearts, for which my soul doth pitty them, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven intreat thee for them, that if possible their eyes may be yet open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their hearts softned, and their spirit humbled, that they may see what they are doing in the dark, and consider the effect of their work, which will assuredly follow: and if thy warnings and gentle vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitations will not humble them, then let thy Judgements awaken them, and bring them down and humble them, that they may perceive some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what thou art doing (in these latter daies) and art resolved to do to the ends of the earth, though the whole world should gather and band together to oppose thy work and people, for thou hast begun (and thou wilt go through and perfect) thy work, thou wilt raise thy seed, and gather thine Elect from the four winds, and bring them from the ends of the Earth, and scatter the proud in the vain imaginations of their hearts, and thou wilt break thy way through all that oppose thee in this the day of thy mighty power, in which thou art arisen (as a Giant to run his race) to finish transgression, and make an end of sin, and to bring in and establish everlasting righteousnes, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world, may become thy Kingdoms, and of thy Christ, as thou hast promised, and art now fulfilling, glory, and honour, and thanks, and everlasting praises, be to thy glorious Name, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, <hi>Amen.</hi>
